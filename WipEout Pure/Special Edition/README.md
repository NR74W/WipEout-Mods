### Notes

To prevent any compatibility/save/unknown issues, it is **mandatory** to remove all WipEout Pure DLC (`UCES00001D`) in the SAVEDATA folder.

The soundbank of Exostra Run was disabled to prevent crash when this track is loaded.

There is also an experimental, alternative version of this mod with all tracks available in Zone mode (Version 2.0b).  
It is available separately because there are issues with the start position in Arcade mode when tracks are used for both Arcade and Zone modes.

The Hard Difficulty and Zone League from the WipEout Pure EX mod are available as an add-on patch (WipEout Pure: Special Edition Extreme).

## Usage

The easiest way to patch the game is to use the batch file (.bat), with a simple drag and drop of the ISO onto the .bat file.  
The output will be created in a new `patch` folder.

Alternatively, the patch can be applied with XDelta v3 using CMD:
```
xdelta3-3.0.11-x86_64.exe -d -s "input.iso" "WipEout Pure - Special Edition v2.0 (Europe).xdelta3" "output.iso"
```
